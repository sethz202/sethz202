I am Seth, a soon to be software engineer.
I graduated from the University of St. Thomas and here are some projects that I worked on during my time at the University. 
1. [War Card Game](https://github.com/sethz202/War-Card-Game)
2. [Webscraper](https://github.com/sethz202/Web-Scrape)
3. [Fukoshiki Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/sethz202/Futoshiki-Puzzle-Solver)
4. [Coffee Shop Kiosk](https://github.com/sethz202/Coffee-Shop-Kiosk)

I am especially proud of the Webscraper and War Card Game as those were some of the first projects that I worked on outside of instruction. While they are not the most optimized or useful programs, they allowed me to extend and apply my learning into areas that interest me. In the future I should definitely go back and rewrite those programs using the knowledge that I now have. Feel free to look into those projects and optimize them yourself if you feel inclined to. If you need to reach me feel free to send me an email at seth@sethz202.dev.
